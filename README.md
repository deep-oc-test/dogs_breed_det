An application to identify Dog's breed, "Dogs breed detector", using deep learning. **133** breeds are known.

[DEEPaaS API V2](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS) is used to access the model functionality.

Dogs breed detector is originally forked from [udacity/dogs-project](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project), dataset comes from [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).

The project applies Transfer learning for dog's breed identification, implemented with Tensorflow and Keras:

From a pre-trained model (VGG16 | VGG19 | Resnet50 | InceptionV3 | Xception) the last layer is removed, then new FC classification layers are added, which is trained. All images first pass through the pre-trained network and converted into the tensor with the shape of the 'before-last' layer of the pre-trained network, into so-called 'bottleneck_features'. These bottleneck_features are used then as input for the FC classification network.
